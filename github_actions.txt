In public repositories, you can use GitHub Actions for free. For private repositories, only a certain amount of monthly usage is available for free - extra usage on top must be paid.

The exact quotas and payment details depend on your GitHub plan, a detailed summary can be found here: https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions

If you can't find an "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository, you can should enable them as described here: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository
